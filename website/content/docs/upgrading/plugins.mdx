# Upgrading Vault Plugins

## External Plugin Upgrade Procedure

The following procedure details steps for upgrading an external plugin that has
been registered to the catalog on a running server. This procedure is
applicable to secret engines, auth methods, and database plugins.

Vault executes plugin binaries when they are configured and roles are established
around them. The binary cannot be modified or replaced while running, so
upgrades cannot be performed by simply swapping the binary and updating the hash
in the plugin catalog.

Instead, you can restart or reload a plugin with the
`sys/plugins/reload/backend` [API][plugin_reload_api]. Follow these steps to
replace or upgrade a Vault plugin binary:

1. [Register][plugin_registration] version 1 of `my-db-plugin` to the catalog.
   Skip this step if your plugin is already registered.

    ```shell-session
    $ vault plugin register -sha256=<SHA256 Hex value of the plugin binary> \
        database \                  # type
        my-db-plugin
    ```

2. [Mount][plugin_management] the plugin backend. Skip this step if the backend
   is already mounted.

    ```shell-session
    $ vault secrets enable database
    ```

3. Register version 2 of `my-db-plugin` to the catalog under the same plugin
   name, but with updated command to run version 2 of `my-db-plugin` and updated
   sha256 of the new binary

    ```shell-session
    $ vault plugin register -sha256=<SHA256 Hex value of the plugin binary> \
        database \                  # type
        my-db-plugin
    ```

4. Trigger a [plugin reload](/docs/commands/plugin/reload) to reload all
   mounted backends using that plugin or a subset of the mounts using that plugin
   with either the `plugin` or `mounts` parameter respectively.

    ```shell-session
    $ vault plugin reload -plugin my-db-plugin
    ```

Until step 4, the mount will still use version 1 of `my-db-plugin`, and when
the reload is triggered, Vault will kill `my-db-plugin`â€™s process and start the
new plugin process for `my-db-plugin` version 2.

-> **Important:** Plugin reload of a new plugin binary must be
performed on each Vault instance. Performing a plugin upgrade on a single
instance or through a load balancer can result in mismatched
plugin binaries within a cluster. On a replicated cluster this may be accomplished
by setting the 'scope' parameter of the reload to 'global'.

## Overriding Built-in Plugins

### Background

Vault's auth methods and secrets engines are structured as plugins, but this
design is not obvious since many of them are built into Vault.

You can see them with the Vault plugin list command, for example, the list of
Secrets engines:

```shell-session
$ vault plugin list secret
Plugins
-------
ad
alicloud
aws
azure
cassandra
consul
gcp
gcpkms
kv
mongodb
mongodbatlas
mssql
mysql
nomad
openldap
pki
postgresql
rabbitmq
ssh
terraform
totp
transit
```

This will list all Secrets engines, internal (built-in) or external. To find
out if a plugin is built-in, we can query its info:

```shell-session
$ vault plugin info secret azure
Key        Value
---        -----
args       []
builtin    true
command    n/a
name       azure
sha256     n/a
```

Because these built-in engines are plugins, they can be overridden. This can be
a useful way to leverage features or bug fixes in plugins that are newer than
the version of Vault you're using, without updating or even restarting Vault,
and while retaining the data for your existing mount.

Assume you have a new version of Azure Secrets and the binary is called
"azure_new". The binary needs to be in the [plugin directory](/docs/plugins/plugin-architecture#plugin-directory)
and can then be registered as either a distinct plugin, or overriding the
current one.

~> **Important:** do not disable (`vault secrets disable ...`) any mount that has
data you're interested in; that would erase storage. For the in-place update,
register a new plugin atop the built-in one and leave any mounts alone.

### Procedure for Overriding Built-in Plugins

The syntax is the same as an external plugin, with the difference being you
name it the same as a built-in:

```shell-session
$ vault plugin register \
  -sha256=<SHA256 Hex value of the plugin binary> \
  -command=azure_new \
  secret \
  azure
```

"-command=azure_new" is the name of the binary, "secret" is the plugin type,
and "azure" is the name of the built-in plugin that we're overriding. We can
verify that the override is in place:

```shell-session
$ vault plugin info secret azure
Key        Value
---        -----
args       []
builtin    false
command    azure_new
name       azure
sha256     f6f6ec45d37484c257aa9ff80444b9f244aaef1c650edf8a42a2a1d3f00db2c5
```

At this point we've overridden the built-in, but it is not yet actively
handling requests. For that we run:

```shell-session
$ vault plugin reload -plugin=azure
```

### Procedure for Reverting After Overriding A Built-in Plugin

To revert the override, first deregister the plugin:

```shell-session
$ vault plugin deregister secret azure
```

Next, verify the override has been reverted and we are now using the built-in
plugin:

```shell-session
$ vault plugin info secret azure
Key        Value
---        -----
args       []
builtin    true
command    n/a
name       azure
sha256     n/a
```

Finally, reload the plugin:

```shell-session
$ vault plugin reload -plugin=azure
```

### Caveats to Overriding Built-in Plugins

* As mentioned earlier, disabling existing mounts will wipe the existing data.
* This type of upgrade affects all uses of the plugin. So if you have 5
  different Azure Secrets mounts, they'll all change after the replacement. If
  you don't want that, you'll need to register the plugin under a different name
  and start with a fresh mount.
* In most cases, data upgrade and downgrade is not an issue. If the "new" version
  introduces new data and you downgrade, the "old" version will ignore the
  extraneous data. In some cases upgrading changes existing data in non-backwards
  compatible ways, so it is good to check whether this is an issue.
