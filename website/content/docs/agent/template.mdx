# Vault Agent Templates

Vault Agent's Template functionality allows Vault secrets to be rendered to files
using [Consul Template markup](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/blob/v0.27.1/docs/templating-language.md).

## Functionality

The `template_config` stanza configures overall default behavior for the
templating engine. Note that `template_config` can only be defined once, and is
different from the `template` stanza. Unlike `template` which focuses on where
and how a specific secret is rendered, `template_config` contains parameters
affecting how the templating engine as a whole behaves and its interaction with
the rest of Agent. This includes, but is not limited to, program exit behavior.
Other parameters that apply to the templating engine as a whole may be added
over time.

The `template` stanza configures the Vault agent for rendering secrets to files
using Consul Template markup language. Multiple `template` stanzas can be
defined to render multiple files.

When the agent is started with templating enabled, it will attempt to acquire a
Vault token using the configured auto-auth Method. On failure, it will back off
for a short while (including some randomness to help prevent thundering herd
scenarios) and retry. On success, secrets defined in the templates will be
retrieved from Vault and rendered locally.

## Templating Language Resources

The following links contain additional resources for the templating language used by Vault Agent templating.

- [Consul Templating Documentation](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/blob/v0.27.1/docs/templating-language.md)
- [Go Templating Language Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#pkg-overview)

## Example Template

Template with Vault Agent requires the use of the `secret` [function from Consul
Template](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template/blob/master/docs/templating-language.md#secret).
The following is an example of a template that retrieves a generic secret from Vault's
KV store:

```
{{ with secret "secret/my-secret" }}
{{ .Data.data.foo }}
{{ end }}
```

## Global Configurations

The top level `template_config` block has the following configuration entries that affect 
all templates:

- `exit_on_retry_failure` `(bool: false)` - This option configures Vault Agent
to exit after it has exhausted its number of template retry attempts due to
failures.

- `static_secret_render_interval` `(string or integer: 5m)` - If specified, configures
  how often Vault Agent Template should render non-leased secrets such as KV v2.
  This setting will not change how often Vault Agent Templating renders leased
  secrets.

### Example

```python
template_config {
  exit_on_retry_failure = true
  static_secret_render_interval = "10m"
}
```

### Interaction between `exit_on_retry_failure` and `error_on_missing_key`

The parameter
[`error_on_missing_key`](/docs/agent/template#error_on_missing_key) can be
specified within the `template` stanza which determines if a template should
error when a key is missing in the secret. When `error_on_missing_key` is not
specified or set to `false` and the key to render is not in the secret's
response, the templating engine will ignore it (or render `"<no value>"`) and
continue on with its rendering.

If the desire is to have Agent fail and exit on a missing key, both
`template.error_on_missing_key` and `template_config.exit_on_retry_failure` must
be set to true. Otherwise, the templating engine will error and render to its
destination, but agent will not exit and will retry until the key exists or until
the process is terminated.

Note that a missing key from a secret's response is different from a missing or
non-existent secret. The templating engine will always error if a secret is
missing, but will only error for a missing key if `error_on_missing_key` is set.
Whether Vault Agent will exit when the templating engine errors depends on the
value of `exit_on_retry_failure`.

## Template Configurations

The top level `template` block has multiple configurations entries:

- `source` `(string: "")` - Path on disk to use as the input template. This
  option is required if not using the `contents` option.
- `destination` `(string: required)` - Path on disk where the rendered secrets should
  be created. If the parent directories do not exist, Vault
  Agent will attempt to create them, unless `create_dest_dirs` is false.
- `create_dest_dirs` `(bool: true)` - This option tells Vault Agent to create
  the parent directories of the destination path if they do not exist.
- `contents` `(string: "")` - This option allows embedding the contents of
  a template in the configuration file rather then supplying the `source` path to
  the template file. This is useful for short templates. This option is mutually
  exclusive with the `source` option.
- `command` `(string: "")` - This is the optional command to run when the
  template is rendered. The command will only run if the resulting template changes.
  The command must return within 30s (configurable), and it must have a successful
  exit code. Vault Agent is not a replacement for a process monitor or init system.
- `command_timeout` `(duration: 30s)` - This is the maximum amount of time to
  wait for the optional command to return.
- `error_on_missing_key` `(bool: false)` - Exit with an error when accessing
  a struct or map field/key that does notexist. The default behavior will print `<no value>`
  when accessing a field that does not exist. It is highly recommended you set this
  to "true".
- `perms` `(string: "")` - This is the permission to render the file. If
  this option is left unspecified, Vault Agent will attempt to match the permissions
  of the file that already exists at the destination path. If no file exists at that
  path, the permissions are 0644.
- `backup` `(bool: true)` - This option backs up the previously rendered template
  at the destination path before writing a new one. It keeps exactly one backup.
  This option is useful for preventing accidental changes to the data without having
  a rollback strategy.
- `left_delimiter` `(string: "{{")` - Delimiter to use in the template. The
  default is "{{" but for some templates, it may be easier to use a different
  delimiter that does not conflict with the output file itself.
- `right_delimiter` `(string: "}}")` - Delimiter to use in the template. The
  default is "}}" but for some templates, it may be easier to use a different
  delimiter that does not conflict with the output file itself.
- `sandbox_path` `(string: "")` - If a sandbox path is provided, any path
  provided to the `file` function is checked that it falls within the sandbox path.
  Relative paths that try to traverse outside the sandbox path will exit with an error.
- `wait` `(object: required)` - This is the `minimum(:maximum)` to wait before rendering
  a new template to disk and triggering a command, separated by a colon (`:`).


### Example

```python
template {
  source      = "/tmp/agent/template.ctmpl"
  destination = "/tmp/agent/render.txt"
}
```

If you only want to use the Vault agent to render one or more templates and do
not need to sink the acquired credentials, you can omit the `sink` stanza from
the `auto_auth` stanza in the agent configuration.

## Renewals and Updating Secrets

The Vault Agent templating automatically renews and fetches secrets/tokens.
Unlike [Vault Agent caching](/docs/agent/caching), the behavior of how Vault Agent
templating does this depends on the type of secret or token. The following is a
high level overview of different behaviors.

### Renewable Secrets

If a secret or token is renewable, Vault Agent will renew the secret after 2/3
of the secret's lease duration has elapsed.

### Non-Renewable Secrets

If a secret or token isn't renewable or leased, Vault Agent will fetch the secret every 5 minutes.
This can be configured using Template config [static_secret_render_interval](/docs/agent/template-config#static_secret_render_interval) (requires Vault 1.8+).
Non-renewable secrets include (but not limited to) [KV Version 2](/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v2).

### Non-Renewable Leased Secrets

If a secret or token is non-renewable but leased, Vault Agent will fetch the secret when 85% of the
secrets time-to-live (TTL) is reached. Leased, non-renewable secrets include (but not limited
to) dynamic secrets such as [database credentials](/docs/secrets/databases) and [KV Version 1](/docs/secrets/kv/kv-v1).

### Static Roles

If a secret has a `rotation_period`, such as a [database static role](/docs/secrets/databases#static-roles),
Vault Agent template will fetch the new secret as it changes in Vault. It does
this by inspecting the secret's time-to-live (TTL).

### Certificates

If a secret is a [certificate](/docs/secrets/pki), Vault Agent template will fetch the new certificate
using the certificates `validTo` field.

This does not apply to certificates generated with `generate_lease: true`. If set
Vault Agent template will apply the non-renewable, leased secret rules.

## Auto Auth and Templating Example

The following demonstrates configuring Vault Agent to template secrets using the
AppRole Auth method:

```python
pid_file = "./pidfile"

vault {
  address = "https://127.0.0.1:8200"
}

auto_auth {
  method {
    type = "approle"

    config = {
      role_id_file_path = "/etc/vault/roleid"
      secret_id_file_path = "/etc/vault/secretid"
    }
  }

  sink {
    type = "file"

    config = {
      path = "/tmp/file-foo"
    }
  }
}

template_config {
  static_secret_render_interval = "10m"
  exit_on_retry_failure = true
}

template {
  source      = "/tmp/agent/template.ctmpl"
  destination = "/tmp/agent/render.txt"
}
```
